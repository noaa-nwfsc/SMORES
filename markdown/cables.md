Use this page to develop a data layer providing the score for submarine cables. You can assign scores that range from 0 (a constraint)/0.001 (most vulnerable) to 0.9 (least vulnerable).

BOEM used the following guide for assigning scores for submarine cables [(NCCOS Report Table 3.2)](https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Appendix%20B_NCCOS%20Final%20WEA%20Report_Oregon.pdf).. 

| Data Layer | Score |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Submarine Cables 0-500 m | 0.6 |
| Submarine Cables 501-1000 m | 0.8 |

\*Note: this framework uses a 2km grid cell size. The decision was made to only include 1 submarine cable layer.
