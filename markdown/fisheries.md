Use this page to develop a combined data layer providing the overall scores for selected fisheries.

NMFS and ODFW provided NCCOS with 5 recommended scoring scenarios for modeling and for BOEM consideration, in order of preference from Scenario 1 (most preferred) to Scenario 5 (least preferred).

|   | Fisheries | Scenario 1 - Trawl \@ 75% | Scenario 2 - Trawl \@ 60% | Scenario 3 - Trawl \@ 50% | Scenario 4 - Trawl \@ 75% | Scenario 5 - "Baseline" |
