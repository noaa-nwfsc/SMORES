Use this page to develop a data layer providing the overall scores for selected fisheries.

NMFS and ODFW provided BOEM with 5 recommended scoring scenarios in order of preference from Scenario 1 (most preferred) to Scenario 5 (least preferred). BOEM selected Scenario 4 because it was the most
conservative scenario that did not include constraints [(NCCOS Report 2.4.4)](https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Appendix%20B_NCCOS%20Final%20WEA%20Report_Oregon.pdf).

|   | Fisheries | Scenario 1 - Trawl \@ 75% | Scenario 2 - Trawl \@ 60% | Scenario 3 - Trawl \@ 50% | Scenario 4 - Trawl \@ 75% | Scenario 5 - "Baseline" |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
