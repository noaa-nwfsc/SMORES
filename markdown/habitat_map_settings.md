Use this page to develop a combined data layer providing the overall scores for selected protected habitats. You can assign scores that range from 0.1 (most vulnerable) to 0.9 (least vulnerable).

NMFS provided 2 scoring scenarios for BOEM's consideration for inclusion in the suitability model. Scenario 2 was chosen for use in the model as it did not contain any constraints (scores of 0). Below is a table to reference the layer and score, for the habitat layers that were outlined in scenario 2.

\*Note: more layers are available to model than the initial Oregon Siting exercise

| Data Layer | Score |
|----|----|
| Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Areas | 0.01 |
| Rocky Reef Groundfish Habitat Areas of Particular Concern - Mapped | 0.01 |
| Rocky Reef Groundfish Habitat Areas of Particular Concern - Probable | 0.2 |
| Deep-Sea Coral Habitat Suitability | Z Membership Function |
| Continental Shelf Break | 0.6 |
| Methane Bubble Streams | 0.8 |
