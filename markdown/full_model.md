This section is to allow a visualization of the scoring scenarios you
have selected for your submodels of choice. The sidebar will indicate
which collections of data have been configured for use. Please start by selecting the submodels that you would like included in this scenario. You will then select
the weight that you would like applied to each submodel you have selected. Selecting the
same weight for each of the submodels indicates that you would like each
submodel to be considered equally. All weights will scale based on your
selections to total 1.The full model will take these choices and
combine them through a weighted geometric mean calculation.
