This section is to allow a visualization of the scoring scenario you have decided over the last few tabs. The sidebar will indicate which collections of data have been configured for use. You can initialize the combined submodel with any combination of these data collections. You will select which calculation method you would like to initialize from the previous tabs (ie. you can have the habitat data layers calculated using the lowest method, the species layers calculated using the product method, and the bird layers using the geometric mean method.The combined submodel will take these choices and combine them using a geometric mean calculation.
