This section is to allow a visualization of the scoring scenario you have decided over the last few tabs. The sidebar will indicate which collections of data have been configured for use. You can initialize the combined submodel with any combination of these data collections. You will select which calculation method you would like to initialize from the previous tabs (ie. you can have the fisheries data layers calculated using the geometric mean, lowest, or product methods).The combined submodel will take the fisheries selected method and replace the score in grid cells within the top 75% of the trawl fisheries' ranked importance values with 0.001.
