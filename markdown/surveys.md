Use this page to develop a combined data layer providing the overall scores for selected scientific surveying activities. You can assign scores that range from 0 (a constraint)/0.001 (most vulnerable) to 0.9 (least vulnerable).

NMFS provided 2 scoring scenarios for BOEM's consideration for inclusion in the suitability model. Scenario 2 was chosen for use in the model as it did not contain any constraints (scores of 0) [(NCCOS Report 2.4.3)](https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/documents/renewable-energy/state-activities/Appendix%20B_NCCOS%20Final%20WEA%20Report_Oregon.pdf). Below is a table to reference the layer and score, for the scientific survey layers that were outlined in scenario 2.

\*Note: different layers are available to model than the initial Oregon Siting exercise

| Data Layer | Score |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| East-West Sampling Corridors | 0.01 |
| Additional East-West Sampling Corridors | 0.5 |
| Survey Stations | 0.5 |
| Survey Transects | 0.5 |
